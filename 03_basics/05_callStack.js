  ## Javacript Execution Context(when you put a file then how JS will run/execute the code)

  (Javascript is a single threaded )

    ** NOTES =>  when you give a code to the JS , one certain thing is always made that is: GLOBAL EXECUTION  CONTEXT. And whereever the Global EC is made, it will be refered to a variable called 'this'

       JS code runs in two phases : 1) Memory Creation Phase (memory is allocated for the for the                                                    variables etc which are declared)
                                    2) Execution Phase ( executions of everything takes place )

   ##CALL STACK: 

    **NOTES: if there is a set of functions called without executing previous ones, then it creates stack which during execution flows the LIFO rule.
